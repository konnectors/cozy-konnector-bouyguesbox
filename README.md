----------------------------------

A connector to retrieve your Bouygues Box bills and billing data and save them into your Cozy.

### Open a Pull-Request

If you want to work on this konnector and submit code modifications, feel free to open pull-requests! See the [contributing guide][contribute] for more information about how to properly open pull-requests.

### Run

If you have a running accessible cozy-stack you can test your modifications to the konnector without installing
and/or updating the konnector in the cozy-stack :

You first need an installed [nodejs] (LTS version is fine).

Then just run (but you need to have proper COZY_CREDENTIALS, COZY_URL and COZY_FIELDS environment variables):

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

Then run (but you have to have proper COZY_CREDENTIALS, COZY_URL and COZY_FIELDS environment variables):

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Where:
 - COZY_CREDENTIALS needs to be the result of ```cozy-stack instances token-cli <instance name> <scope>```
 - COZY_URL is the full http url to your cozy
 - COZY_FIELDS is something like :
```javascript
{
  "data":{
    "attributes":{
      "arguments":{
        "account":"cf31eaef5d899404a7e8c3737c1c2d1f",
        "folder_to_save":"folderPath",
        "slug":"bouyguebox"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The "account" field is the id of the record with doctype "io.cozy.accounts" which will be used as
parameters for your konnector.

### Test

If you do not want to have to install the konnector on a cozy v3 to test it, you can register the
konnector as an OAuth application with the following commands :

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

This command will register your konnector as an OAuth application to the cozy-stack. By default,
the cozy-stack is supposed to be located in http://cozy.tools:8080. If this is not your case, just
update the COZY_URL field in [./data/env.js].

After that, your konnector is running but should not work since you did not specify any credentials to
the target service. You can do this in a [./data/env_fields.json] (you have
[./data/env_fields.json.template] available as a template), where 'login' is your bouygues email address

Now run ```yarn init:dev:account``` to create an account in the targeted cozy which will be used by
the connector (the id of the account is saved in ./data/account.txt)

Now run `yarn dev` one more time, it should be ok.

### Hack

If you do not want to need to have an accessible cozy-stack, just run :

```sh
yarn
yarn standalone
```

The requests to the cozy-stack will be stubbed using the [./data/fixture.json] file as source of data
and when cozy-client is asked to create or update data, the data will be outputed to the console.
The bills (or any file) will be saved in the ./data directory.
